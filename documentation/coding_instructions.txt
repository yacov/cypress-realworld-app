1. Environment Setup: Ensure Cypress is installed and configured for the project. Include necessary plugins like @percy/cypress for visual testing if needed.
2. Support Commands: Utilize custom commands defined in commands.ts for common actions like login, logout, creating transactions, and navigating through the app. This will help in reducing code redundancy and improving test readability.
   Example: 
   ```
   // commands.ts
   Cypress.Commands.add('loginByXstate', (user) => {
     // Implementation details
   });
   ```
3. Data Preparation: Use the cy.task command to interact with the database for seeding or cleaning up data before each test. This ensures a consistent state for test execution.
   Example:
   ```
   // In your test
   cy.task('seedDatabase', { users: 10, transactions: 50 });
   ```
4. API Interception: Implement API call interception for critical workflows to mock or wait for responses, ensuring tests handle asynchronous operations effectively.
   Example:
   ```
   // In your test
   cy.intercept('POST', '/api/transactions', { statusCode: 200, body: 'it works!' }).as('createTransaction');
   cy.wait('@createTransaction');
   ```
5. Expanded Test Scenarios: Cover a wide range of functionalities and edge cases in tests, including form validations, delete operations, and empty states.
6. Visual Regression Testing: Incorporate visual regression tests using tools like @percy/cypress to catch UI regressions.
7. Shared Context and Setup: Use a shared context or detailed beforeEach hooks for centralized test setup, reducing repetitive code and ensuring a consistent test environment.
8. Mobile Testing: Include considerations for different viewport sizes and mobile-specific scenarios in tests to ensure comprehensive coverage across devices.

Test Case Implementation Guide
Feature: Transaction Feeds
File: transaction-feeds.spec.ts
Scenario: User views their recent transactions
Given steps: Use cy.loginByXstate with a predefined user to simulate logging into the account.
And steps: Seed the database with transactions for the logged-in user.
When steps: Navigate to the transaction feed page using cy.visit('/path/to/transaction/feed').
Then steps: Assert that the list of transactions is visible using cy.getBySel('transaction-list').should('be.visible').
Feature: Bank Account Management
File: bankaccounts.spec.ts
Scenario: User adds a new bank account
Follow the general setup for login.
Navigate to the Bank Accounts page.
Interact with the form to add a new bank account using cy.getBySel for form fields and submit the form.
Assert the addition by checking the list of bank accounts for the new entry.
Feature: Transaction Interactions
File: new-transaction.spec.ts
Scenario: User initiates a new transaction
After login, ensure at least one bank account is linked.
Use cy.getBySelLike('new-transaction').click() to initiate a new transaction.
Fill in the transaction details and submit.
Verify the transaction initiation by checking for a success message or the presence of the transaction in the transaction list.
Feature: Notification System
File: notifications.spec.ts
Scenario: User receives a notification for a received transaction
Ensure notifications are enabled for the user.
Simulate receiving a new transaction, possibly by using a backend task or creating a transaction from another test user.
Assert that the notification is received by checking the notifications list for the new transaction notification.
Feature: User Settings Management
File: user-settings.spec.ts
Scenario: User updates their profile information
Login and navigate to the User Settings page.
Update profile information fields and save changes.
Assert that the user's profile information is updated by checking the displayed information on the profile or settings page.
